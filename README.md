# SwiftSSH2
`Swift` wrapper for `libssh2` library.

# NOTICE
This is a *WIP* so please use it at your own risk.
I'm currently working on this whenever I have the time and I'm updating it so I can take it to v1.0.0



__Add something clever here describing how and why__

- [ ] Keep adding missing functions (like Channels, etc)
- [ ] Make tests public (currently testing with personal server)
